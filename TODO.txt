General
-Write paper (make sure to send our source code with the paper)
-Update README with instructions on making and using our file system
-Have directory hierarchy remade on storage nodes instead of storing what the hierarchy is in a map.
-Have a static master IP and port that the master backup takes upon failure
-Look at failure model... (assuming master is dead when we can't talk..)
