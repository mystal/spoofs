\textit{Distributed systems are an important part of the world of computing and are growing in importance yearly. The ability to distribute and parallelize one's workflow has proven key to performing large-scale computations. However, with distributed systems comes the need to share data across multiple computers. Though there are many ways to accomplish this, we explore sharing data via a distributed file system. Distributed file systems store data across multiple machines while also exporting a typical file system interface to distributed applications. We present SPOOFS, an application-level file system that handles the read/write/append tasks of a normal file system by leveraging the storage space of multiple storage servers. In addition, a simple failure model is introduced and we show how SPOOFS can provide some level of fault tolerance to the system as a whole.}
