\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented SPOOFS, a SimPle Object-Oriented File System.  SPOOFS is a distributed file system that leverages multiple Storage nodes to store its data and exports a common interface to Clients for read/write/append and metadata operations.  We have outlined the design decisions that influenced SPOOFS and described our implementation of many standard distributed file system features.  We have also presented a failure model, wherein the Master node crashes and comes offline completely, and shown how SPOOFS is resilient enough to recover from it.  In addition, we have discussed numerous drawbacks in SPOOFS, and outlined some approaches we would use to address them.
